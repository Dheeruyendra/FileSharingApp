- **Persistence**: Files are stored on the server, allowing for access at any time.

## How to Use

1. **Upload a File**: Navigate to the upload section and select a file to share.
2. **Get Shareable Link**: After the upload is complete, a link is generated for sharing.
3. **Download**: Access the file via the provided link and download it directly from the server.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: The frontend is built with modern JavaScript, utilizing frameworks and libraries for a responsive user interface.
- **Backend**: The backend is powered by Node.js and Express.js, handling file uploads and serving the frontend.
- **Database**: File metadata is stored in a database for retrieval and link generation.
